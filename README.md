## Introduction to VoxEdit

VoxEdit is a user-friendly software developed specifically for creating voxel-based 3D models. Voxels are 3D pixels, and voxel-based art has gained popularity due to its blocky and retro aesthetic reminiscent of classic video games. VoxEdit takes this concept to the next level, allowing you to create intricate voxel models with ease.

VoxEdit provides a range of tools and features that make the modeling process intuitive and enjoyable. From sculpting and texturing to animation and exporting, VoxEdit covers all aspects of voxel-based art creation. It's widely used by artists, game developers, and enthusiasts to bring their voxel creations to life.

## Installation and Setup

To get started with VoxEdit, follow these steps to install and set up the software:

1. Visit the official VoxEdit website at [voxedit.io](https://www.voxedit.io/).
2. Look for the download section and choose the appropriate version for your operating system (Windows, macOS).
3. Download the installation file and run it.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation process.

Once you've installed VoxEdit and set up your account, you're ready to start creating your voxel masterpieces!

## Interface Overview

When you launch VoxEdit, you'll be greeted with a clean and intuitive interface. Let's take a brief tour of the key elements:

- **Menu Bar**: Located at the top, it provides access to various functionalities such as file operations, editing, viewing options, and more.

- **Tool Palette**: Usually situated on the left or right side, it contains a selection of tools and brushes for sculpting, painting, and modifying your voxel models.

- **Viewport**: The central area of the interface where you'll see your 3D model. You can rotate, zoom, and pan the view to get a better look at your creation.

- **Timeline**: If you're working on an animation, the timeline panel appears at the bottom. It enables you to create and edit keyframes, control playback, and manage animation sequences.

## Creating a New Project

To start a new project in VoxEdit, follow these steps:

1. Open VoxEdit if it's not already running.
2. Click on **File** in the menu bar.
3. Select **New Project** from the dropdown menu.
4. Choose the desired project settings, such as size and frame rate, and click **Create**.
5. A new project will be created, and you'll be ready to start building your voxel model.

Remember to save your project regularly to avoid losing your progress. You can use the **Save** or **Save As** options under the **File** menu to save your work.

In the next sections of this tutorial, we'll dive deeper into the specific tools and features of VoxEdit, guiding you through the process of creating impressive voxel-based models and animations.

## Building Blocks: Voxels and Palettes

Voxels are the fundamental building blocks of voxel-based 3D models. In VoxEdit, you work with voxels to create your voxel art. Each voxel represents a small cube-like element that can be colored, textured, and positioned in 3D space.

### Voxels

To create and manipulate voxels in VoxEdit, you can use various tools and brushes available. These tools allow you to add, remove, modify, and sculpt voxels to shape your model. You can adjust the size, position, and color of voxels to create intricate details and structures.

VoxEdit provides a grid-based system where you can place voxels precisely within the 3D workspace. By arranging voxels strategically, you can bring your designs to life and create stunning voxel art.

### Palettes

Palettes in VoxEdit are collections of colors or materials that you can use to paint and texture your voxels. Palettes enable you to define and manage a set of colors or materials that suit your project's theme or style.

You can create custom palettes by selecting colors or materials and saving them for future use. Having a well-organized palette makes it easier to apply consistent colors and materials throughout your model.

With the combination of voxels and palettes, you have the flexibility to create intricate voxel art with vibrant colors and textures.

In the upcoming sections of this tutorial, we'll explore how to sculpt and modify voxels, apply textures and materials, animate your models, and more. Let's continue our journey into the world of voxel-based art with VoxEdit!
