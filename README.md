- **Timeline**: If you're working on an animation, the timeline panel appears at the bottom. It enables you to create and edit keyframes, control playback, and manage animation sequences.

## Creating a New Project

To start a new project in VoxEdit, follow these steps:

1. Open VoxEdit if it's not already running.
2. Click on **File** in the menu bar.
3. Select **New Project** from the dropdown menu.
4. Choose the desired project settings, such as size and frame rate, and click **Create**.
5. A new project will be created, and you'll be ready to start building your voxel model.

Remember to save your project regularly to avoid losing your progress. You can use the **Save** or **Save As** options under the **File** menu to save your work.

In the next sections of this tutorial, we'll dive deeper into the specific tools and features of VoxEdit, guiding you through the process of creating impressive voxel-based models and animations.

## Building Blocks: Voxels and Palettes

Voxels are the fundamental building blocks of voxel-based 3D models. In VoxEdit, you work with voxels to create your voxel art. Each voxel represents a small cube-like element that can be colored, textured, and positioned in 3D space.

### Voxels

To create and manipulate voxels in VoxEdit, you can use various tools and brushes available. These tools allow you to add, remove, modify, and sculpt voxels to shape your model. You can adjust the size, position, and color of voxels to create intricate details and structures.

VoxEdit provides a grid-based system where you can place voxels precisely within the 3D workspace. By arranging voxels strategically, you can bring your designs to life and create stunning voxel art.

### Palettes

Palettes in VoxEdit are collections of colors or materials that you can use to paint and texture your voxels. Palettes enable you to define and manage a set of colors or materials that suit your project's theme or style.

You can create custom palettes by selecting colors or materials and saving them for future use. Having a well-organized palette makes it easier to apply consistent colors and materials throughout your model.

With the combination of voxels and palettes, you have the flexibility to create intricate voxel art with vibrant colors and textures.

In the upcoming sections of this tutorial, we'll explore how to sculpt and modify voxels, apply textures and materials, animate your models, and more. Let's continue our journey into the world of voxel-based art with VoxEdit!

# What are Voxels?

## Understanding the Basics

Voxels are three-dimensional (3D) pixels, representing the building blocks of a virtual 3D space. Unlike traditional polygon-based models, which consist of interconnected triangles, voxels are individual volumetric elements that fill up the 3D environment. Think of voxels as tiny cubes, each having its own position in space and defined by its color, material, and other properties.

## Voxel vs. Polygon-Based Models

The main distinction between voxels and polygon-based models lies in their representation and rendering techniques. While polygon-based models use flat surfaces to construct 3D shapes, voxels create objects from a collection of individual volumetric elements. This fundamental difference impacts how models are designed, stored, and processed in virtual environments.

## Advantages of Voxels in Virtual Worlds

Voxels offer several advantages in the context of virtual worlds and 3D asset creation:

1. **Easy Manipulation**: Voxels provide a simple and intuitive way to create and edit 3D objects. Artists and creators can easily modify individual voxels or groups of voxels to sculpt detailed structures.

2. **Dynamic Environments**: With voxels, dynamic and interactive environments become more manageable. Objects created with voxels can be easily destructible, making them ideal for games with physics-based interactions.

3. **Efficient Storage**: Storing voxel data requires less memory compared to polygon-based models. This efficiency is especially beneficial when dealing with vast and complex virtual worlds.

4. **Procedural Generation**: Voxels enable procedural generation techniques, allowing developers to generate complex terrains, landscapes, and structures algorithmically.

5. **Retro Aesthetics**: Voxels have a distinct retro aesthetic that appeals to nostalgic gamers and creators alike. Games and virtual experiences that use voxels often evoke a charming pixel art style.

# Sculpting and Modifying Voxels in VoxEdit

VoxEdit is a powerful voxel modeling tool that empowers artists and creators to design and sculpt 3D assets for virtual worlds, games, and the metaverse. In this article, we'll dive into the fascinating world of voxel sculpting and explore the various tools and techniques VoxEdit offers to bring your creative visions to life.

## Understanding Sculpting in VoxEdit

Sculpting in VoxEdit allows you to shape and manipulate individual voxels, providing a way to craft intricate details and unique forms for your voxel creations. Whether you're designing characters, environments, or props, the sculpting tools give you the freedom to add, remove, smooth, and refine your voxel models with ease.

## Getting Started with Sculpting

To begin sculpting in VoxEdit, open your desired project or create a new one. Once inside the editor, navigate to the **Sculpt Mode** to access the sculpting tools. The sculpting mode provides a range of brush types, each tailored for specific sculpting tasks.

## Voxel Brush and Brush Settings

The **Voxel Brush** is the primary tool for sculpting in VoxEdit. It allows you to interact with voxels in the 3D workspace and modify their positions, colors, and materials. The brush's size and strength can be adjusted to control the impact of your sculpting actions. Additionally, you can customize the brush falloff to control the blending between voxels, achieving smooth transitions or sharp edges.

## Sculpting Techniques

VoxEdit offers several sculpting techniques to help you craft intricate voxel models:

- **Adding Voxels**: Use the voxel brush to add new voxels, allowing you to build up your model's structure and details.

- **Removing Voxels**: When refining your design, the remove voxel function lets you erase unwanted elements or smooth out surfaces.

- **Smoothing**: The smoothing tool softens the edges of your voxels, creating more organic and polished shapes.

- **Blending**: Blending voxels helps you create transitions between different materials or colors seamlessly.

- **Extruding and Insetting**: These techniques allow you to push or pull voxel surfaces, giving depth and dimension to your models.

## Symmetry and Mirror Sculpting

Symmetry is an essential feature in voxel sculpting. VoxEdit provides symmetry options to maintain balance in your design, enabling you to sculpt one side while automatically mirroring the changes to the other side. This symmetry feature is incredibly useful when creating symmetrical characters, creatures, or structures.

## Sculpting Tips and Best Practices

As you dive into voxel sculpting, consider the following tips to enhance your workflow:

- **Use Reference Images**: Import reference images or concept art to guide your sculpting process and ensure accuracy.

- **Iterative Sculpting**: Iterate through multiple passes, gradually refining your model to achieve the desired level of detail.

- **Save Versions**: Save different versions of your sculpt to experiment with various design ideas.
